                General Facts
                Natural Satellite: The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth-largest moon in the Solar System.
                
                Distance from Earth: The average distance to the Moon is about 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles).
                
                Size and Composition: The Moon has a diameter of about 3,474 kilometers (2,159 miles). It‚Äôs primarily composed of rock and metal.
                
                Phases of the Moon
                The Moon goes through a cycle of phases, which include:
                
                New Moon: The Moon is between Earth and the Sun, making it nearly invisible.
                
                Waxing Crescent: A small part of the Moon becomes visible.
                
                First Quarter: Half of the Moon is illuminated.
                
                Waxing Gibbous: More than half of the Moon is illuminated.
                
                Full Moon: The entire face of the Moon is illuminated.
                
                Waning Gibbous: The illumination starts decreasing.
                
                Last Quarter: Half of the Moon is visible again.
                
                Waning Crescent: A small part is visible before it becomes a New Moon again.
                
                Surface Features
                Craters: The Moon‚Äôs surface is covered with craters formed by asteroid impacts.
                
                Maria: Dark, flat areas called ‚Äúmaria‚Äù (Latin for "seas"), formed by ancient volcanic eruptions.
                
                Highlands: Elevated areas compared to the maria, more rugged and heavily cratered.
                
                Lunar Exploration
                First Human Landing: Apollo 11 mission in 1969, where astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the Moon.
                
                Recent Missions: Various countries and private companies are planning future missions to the Moon, including potential plans for lunar bases.
                
                Influence on Earth
                Tides: The Moon's gravitational pull affects Earth's tides.
                
                Stabilizing Earth: The Moon helps to stabilize Earth's axial tilt, which contributes to a relatively stable climate.
                
                Cultural Impact
                The Moon has a significant presence in human culture, influencing mythology, art, literature, and calendars.
                
                Interesting Facts
                Synchronous Rotation: The Moon always shows the same face to Earth due to synchronous rotation.
                
                Moonquakes: The Moon experiences quakes called "moonquakes," likely caused by gravitational interactions with Earth.
